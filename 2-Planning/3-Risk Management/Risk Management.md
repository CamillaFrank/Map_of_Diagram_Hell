Recognising and managing potential and unforeseen trouble spots that can occur.

## Risk Management Process

- **Step 1: Risk process initiation**
- **Step 2: Risk Identification**
	- Broadly: analyse the project to identify sources of risks
	- Methods: 
		- Brainstorm, SWOT analysis, Interviews (with key stakeholders), Checklist and experiences from past projects, Deep analysis of assumptions and constraints, Consultants
		- [[Risk Breakdown Structure (RiBS)]]
- **Step 3: Risk Assessment** (and Classification)
	- Assess identified risks in terms of
		- Severity of impact
		- Likelihood of occurring
		- Controllability
	- [[Risk Severity Matrix]]
- **Step 4: Risk Response Development**
	- How are we going to deal with the risk?
		- Mitigate (reduce/enhance): try to minimize the impact of the risk should it occur
		- Avoid (exploit): implement strategies to avoid the risk
		- Transfer (share): Pass the risk to another party (e.g. insurance)
		- Accept: some risks we have to accept. Some are to big to avoid/transfer/mitigate, some can be absorbed in the budge.
	- Contingency planning: what to do if a risk becomes a reality
		- Must take into consideration project priorities 
		- Contingency plans can be used to build a [[Risk Response Matrix (RRM)]]
- **Step 5: Risk Response Control**
	- After the first steps, we can develop a [[Risk Register]]
	- Risk Response Control then uses the Risk Register during project execution. As always: living document!
- **Step 6: Risk Review**
	- Reviewing if we have covered everything often iterative process
- **(Step 7: Post-Project Review)**
	- Useful component in the closing phases of the project â€“ how well did our risk register work
	- Should we change our approach to risk planning and management?
