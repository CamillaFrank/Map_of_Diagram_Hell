#topicPLAN
*Schedules, Budgets, Resources, Risks, Staffing*

- Project Estimation
- Scheduling
- Risk Management
- Resource and Cost Scheduling 
	- Once we have a budget baseline, we can during the Executing phase compare our spend against planned spend

### Key Points from "The Mythical Man Month" (Brooks, 1995):
1. **Poor Estimation**: Assuming everything goes well, not realistic.
2. **Effort vs. Progress**: Effort does not always equal progress.
3. **Lack of Courageous Managers**: Causes problems with stakeholders.
4. **Poor Progress Monitoring**: Leads to uncertainty about project status.
5. **Late Addition of Resources**: Increases project costs.
6. **Communication**: Often overlooked but crucial (training and intercommunication).

## Planning Phase Process
Process WBS to Project plan:
1. Review the POS for clarity(check)
2. Create detailed Work Breakdown Structure
3. Estimate task/activity duration and resource needs for tasks and WPs
4. Convert the WBS to a Network Diagram (taking into account organisational structure â€“who does what?)
5. Determine the critical path(CP) and other AON features (incl. lag)
6. Revise and approve the project schedule
7. Finalize resource schedules (time-phased budget, next week)
8. Gain consensus on the project plan
