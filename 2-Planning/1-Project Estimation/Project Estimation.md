#subtopicPLAN
The process of forecasting or approximating the resources, time and cost of completing project deliverables. The task of balancing the expectations of stakeholders and the later need for control while the project is implemented.

Practice is often to:
1. Develop [[Top-down Estimate]]
2. Develop the WBS/PBS + OBS (organisation breakdown structure, assigns responsibility in org for WPs)
3. Make [[Bottom-up Estimate]]
4. Develop schedules, budgets ...
5. Reconcile differences between top-down and bottom-up estimates + document estimates and assumptions
6. AND ONLY THEN DO YOU FINALIZE WITH THE CLIENT â€“ keep false expectations to a minimum
7. During project execution, we constantly monitor work done against estimates
