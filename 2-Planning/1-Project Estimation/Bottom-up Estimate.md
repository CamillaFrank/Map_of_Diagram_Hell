Works from detailed descriptions of the project and then work upwards. Performed by the people doing the work.

## Methods
- **Template Method.** If the project is similar to past projects, then template methods can be used as a starting point for the new project. Templates are created based on the costs of previous, similar projects.

- **Parametric Procedures Applied to Specific Tasks.** Just as parametric techniques such as cost per square foot can be the source of top-down estimates, the same technique can be applied to specific tasks.

- **Range estimating.** Works best when work packages have significant uncertainty associated with the time or cost to complete. Use Low, Average and High.
