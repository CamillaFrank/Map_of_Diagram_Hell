Relies on analogy, group consensus, or mathematical relationships. Often done by senior management

## Methods
- **Consensus Method.** This method simply uses the pooled experience of senior and/or middle managers to estimate the total project duration and cost.

- **Ratio Method.** Top-down methods (sometimes called parametric) usually use ratios, or surrogates, to estimate project times or costs. Top-down ratio methods are often used in the concept, or “need,” phase of a project to get an initial duration and cost estimate for the project.

- **Apportion Method.** This method is an extension to the ratio method. Apportionment is used when projects closely follow past projects in features and costs.

- **Function Point Methods for Software and System Projects.** In the software industry, software development projects are frequently estimated using weighted macro variables called function points or major parameters such as number of inputs, number of outputs, number of inquiries, number of data files, and number of interfaces.

- **Learning Curves.** Some projects require that the same task, group of tasks, or product be repeated several times. The time to perform a task improves with repetition.
