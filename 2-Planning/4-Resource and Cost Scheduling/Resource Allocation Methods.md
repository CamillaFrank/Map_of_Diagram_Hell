If we do not have the resources to carry out all activities at the time specified by the AON diagram, we need to integrate these limitations in our plan. (Dealing with Constraints)

### Assumptions of resource allocation methods
These assumptions underlie all the allocation methods.
1. **Splitting activities will not be allowed**.
	- Splitting refers to interrupting work on one task and assigning the resources to work on a different task for a period of time, then reassigning them to work on the original task. 
	- No splitting means that once an activity is placed in the schedule, assume it will be worked on continuously until it is finished.
2. **The level of resources used for an activity cannot be changed**
3. **Risk Assumptions:**
	- Activities with the most slack pose the least risk.
	- Reduction of flexibility does not increase risk.
	- The nature of an activity (easy, complex) doesnâ€™t increase risk
