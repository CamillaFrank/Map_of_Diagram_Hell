Used for [[Time-constrained Project]]s
Delay noncritical activities by using positive slack to reduce peak demand and fill in the valleys for the resources without delaying the entire project.

Goals of Smoothing Resource Demand:
- Reduce the peak of demand for the resource
- Reduce the number of resources over the life of the project
- Minimize the fluctuation in resource demand

Downside of Smoothing Resource Demand
- Loss of flexibility that occurs from reducing slack
- Creates more critical activities and/or near-critical activities because of slack reduction

### Botanical Garden Example
The Botanical Garden project uses only one resource (backhoes); all backhoes are interchangeable.
- Only two activities have slack that can be used to reduce the peakâ€”fence and walls provide the best choice for smoothing the resource needs.
