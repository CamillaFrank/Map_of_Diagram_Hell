The planned network and activity project duration times did not take into account resource usage and availability. Resource and cost scheduling means using the resources available for the project and creating a time-phased budget that provides the project budget baseline.

- [[Constraints]]
- Classification of a Scheduling Problem
	- [[Time-constrained Project]]
	- [[Resource-constrained Project]]
	- Consult Project Priority Matrix (PPM) to determine if the project is time-or resource-constrained
	- One simple test is to ask, “If the critical path is delayed, will resources be added to get back on schedule?” If the answer is yes, assume the project is time constrained; if no, assume the project is resource constrained.
