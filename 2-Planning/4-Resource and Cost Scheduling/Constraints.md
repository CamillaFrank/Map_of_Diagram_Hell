- Technical or Logical Constraints
	- Are related to the networked sequence in which project activities must occur (must to A before B etc.).
- Resource Constraints
	- Occur when the absence, shortage, or unique interrelationship and interaction characteristics of resources require a particular sequencing of project activities.
	- Fx constraints on: People, Materials and Equipment.

Note that the resource dependency takes priority over the technological dependency but does not violate the technological dependency.

Activities 2, 3, and 4 could be done in parallel by different people. There is no technical reason or dependency of one on another. However, if one person must perform all activities, the resource constraint requires that the activities be performed in sequence or series. Clearly the consequence is a delay of these activities and a very different set of network relationships.
