*uses desired rates-of-return to compute the value of projects*

The net present value (NPV) model uses managementâ€™s minimum desired rate of return (discount rate, for example, 15 percent) to compute the present value of all net cash inflows. If the result is positive (the project meets the minimum desired rate of return), it is eligible for further consideration. If the result is negative, the project is rejected. Thus, higher positive NPVs are desirable

### Example
Project A has an initial investment of $700,000 and projected cash inflows of $225,000 for 5 years.
The NPV model accepts project A, which has a positive NPV of $54,235.

Project B has an initial investment of $400,000 and projected cash inflows of $110,000 for 5 years.
Project B is rejected, since the NPV is negative $31,263.
