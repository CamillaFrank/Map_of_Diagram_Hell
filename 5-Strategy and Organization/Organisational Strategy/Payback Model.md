*how fast a project will recover its costs.*
The payback model measures the time it will take to recover the project investment. Shorter paybacks are more desirable. Payback is the simplest and most widely used model.

The major limitations of payback are that it ignores the time value of money, assumes cash inflows for the investment period (and not beyond), and does not consider profitability.

### Example
Project A has an initial investment of $700,000 and projected cash inflows of $225,000 for 5 years.
The payback for project A is 3.1 years

Project B has an initial investment of $400,000 and projected cash inflows of $110,000 for 5 years.
The payback for project B is 3.6 years
