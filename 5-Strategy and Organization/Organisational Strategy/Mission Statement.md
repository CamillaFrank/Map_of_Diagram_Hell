The mission identifies â€œwhat we want to become.
Mission statements identify the scope of the organization in terms of its product or service.

Mission statements change infrequently. However, when the nature of the business changes or shifts, revised mission and strategy statements may be required.

More specific mission statements tend to give better results because of a tighter focus.
