Strategies for Encouraging Functional Conflict
1. **Create a Shared Vision**:
    - Establish common goals to provide a basis for resolving disputes constructively.
    - Prioritize project aspects (cost, schedule, scope) to guide decision-making.
2. **Encourage Healthy Dissent**:
    - Ask tough questions and challenge recommendations.
    - Bring diverse perspectives to critical meetings.
    - Designate a devil’s advocate or take time to list reasons against a proposed action.
3. **Model Appropriate Responses**:
    - Avoid defensiveness when challenged.
    - Exhibit effective listening skills and summarize key points before responding.
    - Protect and value dissenters to avoid creating a culture of yes-men.
