Challenges:
- **Part-Time Involvement:** Team members often work part-time on multiple projects, leading to divided attention and allegiance.
- **Abstraction of Projects:** For specialists, specific projects can seem abstract, reducing their motivation.

Strategies for Developing a Unique Team Identity:
- **Team Meetings:**
  - **Communication Forum:** Regular meetings provide a platform to share project information.
  - **Reinforcing Identity:** Meetings make the team tangible by allowing members to see they are part of a larger effort.
  - **Defining Membership:** Gatherings help define who is on the team and reinforce collective identity.

- **Co-location of Team Members:**
  - **Common Space:** Having members work together in a shared space strengthens team identity.

- **Team Names and Logos:**
  - **Team Name:** Creating a unique team name, like "A-Team" or "Caseyâ€™s Crusaders," helps solidify team identity.
  - **Team Logo:** Developing a logo to accompany the team name enhances this identity further.
  - **Symbolic Items:** Affix the team name and logo to items such as stationery, T-shirts, and coffee mugs to signify team membership.

- **Collaborative Activities:**
  - **Early Joint Tasks:** Working together on something early in the project fosters a sense of teamwork.
  - **Social Activities:** Hosting events like a potluck dinner where team members bring dishes from their countries can build camaraderie.

- **Team Rituals:**
  - **Symbolic Actions:** Establishing rituals at the project level creates a unique team subculture.
  - **Examples:**
    - **Milestone Ties:** Giving ties with stripes corresponding to project milestones and cutting off a stripe after each milestone is reached.
    - **Toy Roaches:** Recognizing bug finders in a design project with toy roaches, where the size of the toy correlates with the significance of the bug.
  - **Special Status:** Such rituals distinguish project work from mainstream operations and reinforce the team's special status.
