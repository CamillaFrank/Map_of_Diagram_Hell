Project vision is an image project team members hold in common about how the project will look upon completion, how they will work together, and/or how customers will accept the project.
“What do we want to create?”

Project managers facilitate the formation of a shared vision rather than directly creating it.

Purpose and Impact:
- **Inspiration:** A vision inspires team members to give their best effort.
- **Unity:** It unites professionals with different backgrounds and agendas towards a common goal.
- **Motivation:** Encourages team members to prioritize the project over individual agendas.
- **Focus:** Provides focus and helps communicate intangible priorities, aiding in judgment calls.
- **Commitment:** Fosters long-term commitment and discourages short-term expedient responses that can compromise project quality.
