1. **Forming:** Members get acquainted and understand the project's scope, establishing acceptable behaviours and roles. This stage ends when they see themselves as a group.
2. **Storming:** Marked by internal conflict, members accept being part of the group but resist constraints, leading to clashes over control and decision-making. Resolution of these conflicts solidifies the project manager's leadership.
3. **Norming:** Close relationships develop, and the group becomes cohesive, with a shared sense of responsibility and established expectations for collaboration.
4. **Performing:** The team is fully functional and focused on achieving project goals, with group energy directed towards performance.
5. **Adjourning:** The team prepares to disband, shifting focus from high performance to project completion. Members may feel a mix of pride and sadness over the project's end.
