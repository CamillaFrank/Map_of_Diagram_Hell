**Definition**:
Groupthink occurs when a highly cohesive team prioritizes unanimity and conformity over critical evaluation, leading to poor decision-making.

**Symptoms**:
1. **Illusion of Invulnerability**:
   - The team feels invincible and overly optimistic, fostering complacency.
2. **Whitewash of Critical Thinking**:
   - Limited discussion of alternatives and a failure to examine potential adverse consequences.
3. **Negative Stereotypes of Outsiders**:
   - Outsiders who oppose the group are seen as incompetent or malicious, and their points are dismissed.
4. **Direct Pressure**:
   - Dissenters within the team face pressure to conform, with an emphasis on agreement over argument.

**Prevention**:
- Encourage diverse viewpoints and critical thinking.
- Designate a devil's advocate to question assumptions.
- Foster an open environment where questioning and dissent are valued.
