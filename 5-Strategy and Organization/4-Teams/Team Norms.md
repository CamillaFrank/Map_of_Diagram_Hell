Project managers play a major role in establishing team norms through personal example. If they freely admit mistakes and share what they have learned from them, other team members will do the same. At the same time, project managers need to intervene when they believe such norms are being violated.

Examples of some of the norms researchers have found to be associated with high-performance
teams.
- Confidentiality is maintained; no information is shared outside the team unless all agree to it.
- It is acceptable to be in trouble, but it is not acceptable to surprise others.
- Tell others immediately when deadlines or milestones will not be reached.
- There is zero tolerance for bulling a way through a problem or an issue.
- Agree to disagree, but when a decision has been made, regardless of personal feelings, move forward.
- Respect outsiders, and do not flaunt oneâ€™s position on the project team.
- Hard work does not get in the way of having fun.
