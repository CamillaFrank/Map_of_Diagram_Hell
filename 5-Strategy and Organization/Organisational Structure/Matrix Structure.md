Major management innovation a hybrid organisational form where a horizontal project management structure is overlaid on the normal functional hierarchies (many variations!)
This structure is designed to optimally use resources by having individuals work on multiple projects and perform their normal functional duties, while also giving PMs more authority.

| Pros                                                                                                                   | Cons                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Efficient: resources can be shared across multiple projects and within functional divisions.                           | Dysfunctional conflict: tension between function managers and PMs is built-in. Easy to let this get personal |
| Strong project focus: stronger project focus by having designated PMs, who coordinate contributions of different units | Infighting: when equipment/staff is shared across projects and functional activities, conflict can arise     |
| Easier Post-Project Transition: Specialists maintain ties with their functional group, homeport to return to           | Stressful: No unity of command–multiple bosses is stressful to staff.                                        |
| Flexible: more flexible use of resources than other models                                                             | Slow: Decision-making can get bogged down (depends on matrix model –Weak, Balanced, Strong).                 |
