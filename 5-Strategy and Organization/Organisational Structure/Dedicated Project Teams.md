Project teams are separated from the functional units, they do not form part of them. Staff are “pulled” from the functional units.
Interface with parent org can vary with varying degrees of freedom (e.g. financial control)

| Simple: the functional organisation remains intact apart from staff being pulled away into projects                                               | Expensive: this creates a whole new management position and requires full-time resourcing of staff. Can result in duplication of effort across projects.                     |
| Fast: Projects can get done more quickly when staff devote full time to project, less hierarchy to worry about                                    | Internal strife: Conflict can emerge between org and project team. Undermines integration of project outcomes and staff back in functions                                    |
| Cohesive: High level of team motivation and cohesiveness emerges, common goal and responsibility.                                                 | Limited technological expertise: self-contained team can limit the technological expertise in the org being brought to bear on the project (we-they syndrome)                |
| Cross-functional Integration: specialists work together and with proper guidance commit to optimize the project, not just their area of expertise | Difficult post-project transition: what to do with staff once project is completed? If no other project, then they fold back to functions, but they have been absent from it |
