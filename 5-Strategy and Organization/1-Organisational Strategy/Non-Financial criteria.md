Financial return, while important, does not always reflect strategic importance. Companies have to be disciplined in saying no to potentially profitable projects that are outside the realm of their core mission. This requires other criteria be considered beyond direct financial return.

For example, a firm may support projects that do not have high profit margins for other strategic reasons, including:
- To capture larger market share.
- To make it difficult for competitors to enter the market.
- To develop an enabler product, which by its introduction will increase sales in more profitable products.
- To develop core technology that will be used in next-generation products.
- To reduce dependency on unreliable suppliers.
- To prevent government intervention and regulation.
