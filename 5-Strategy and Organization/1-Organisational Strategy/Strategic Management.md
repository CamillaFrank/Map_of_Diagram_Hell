The processes of assessing “what we are” and deciding and implementing “what we intend to be and how we are going to get there”.

Strategic management requires strong links among mission, goals, objectives, strategy, and
implementation. The mission gives the general purpose of the organization. Goals give global targets within the mission. Objectives give specific targets to goals. Objectives give rise to the formulation of strategies to reach objectives. Finally, strategies require actions and tasks to be implemented.

1. Review and define the organizational [[Mission Statement|mission]].
2. Analyze and formulate strategies.
3. Set [[Organizational Objectives|objectives]] to achieve strategies.
