how an organisation manages its projects

A company can have different types of projects:
- Compliance: Must-do, typically to meet regulation requirements. Emergency projects. Strong penalties if we do not do these projects. 
- Operational: What we need to support current operations. Improves performance in general. E.g. installing new piece of equipment to make production faster.
- Strategic: Those that support the organisations long-term mission. Aims to increase revenue or market share, competitive edge. New products, new development.
