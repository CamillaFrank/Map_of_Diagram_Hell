*How an organisation will compete*
Strategy describes how an organisation intends to compete with the resources available in the existing and perceived future environment

PMs must know and understand the strategy of the organisation
- If PMs understand organisational strategy, they can make decisions in projects to support it. E.g., does company want to lead through low-cost focus or enhanced performance focus? 
- To be effective project advocates. PMs need to demonstrate to senior management that their project contributes to the firm’s mission. Support comes from being aligned with objectives.

[[Enviornment]] can also have an impact on a organisations strategy.

Strategies are implemented through projects, so we need to be able to select projects in a good way and manage all of our projects –this is a big component of [[Strategic Management]].

Projects are the implementation of strategy: Organisations use projects to convert strategy into products, services and processes
