Used to define project priorities by deciding on importance of time, performance and cost.

- Constrain. The original parameter is fixed. The project must meet the completion date, specifications and scope of the project, or budget.
- Enhance. Given the scope of the project, which criterion should be optimized? In the case of time and cost, this usually means taking advantage of opportunities to either reduce costs or shorten the schedule. Conversely, with regard to performance, enhancing means adding value to the project.
- Accept. For which criterion is it tolerable not to meet the original parameters? When trade-offs have to be made, is it permissible to allow the schedule to slip, to reduce the scope and performance of the project, or to go over budget?
