## Definition Phase Process
Definition-phase documents feed into each other:
- COS(conditions of satisfaction)
	- Defines the criteria for success
- POS(project overview statement)
	- What must be done, Why, Business Value
- RBS(requirements breakdown structure)
	- States the requirements
- WBS(work breakdown structure)
	- Describes all work to be done â€“as defined by the RBS

When the WBS is done, we can start the planning process.
