Concise description of the requirements

![[RBS_example.png]]

- Requirement
	- Function
		- (Sub-function if complex system)
			- Processes
				- Activities
					- Features

Requirements decomposition involves taking the [[Conditions of Satisfaction (COS)]] criteria and translating these into high-level requirements. We then decompose these high-level requirements into functions and processes that are detailed enough that we can define system features.

**4 types of requirements:**
1. Functional requirements: what the product/service does (“user can save the game”)
2. Non-functional requirements: qualities that make the product/service attractive and usable –user experience, performance criteria (“product shall be attractive to the target audience”)
3. Global requirements: describes properties of the system as a whole (often hidden non-functional requirement) (“system must be scalable”)
4. Product and/or project constraints: for example, design constraints (must follow company design) or project constraints (budget, schedule, deadlines)
