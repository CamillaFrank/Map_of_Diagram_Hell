Document that must be approved before detailed planning can begin.

The POS is a short, 1-page document that concisely state what is to be done, why it is to be done, and what business value the project will provide once completed. 
Main purpose of the POS is to secure management (and client) approval and the resources needed for developing a detailed plan.

POS has 5 components: 
1. Problem or opportunity (or client request, corporate initiative)
2. Project goal: what do you intend to do? One goal only, expressed to be: specific, measurable, assignable, realistic, time-related
3. Project objectives (deliverables) (can include milestones) Four parts to each: outcome, time frame, measure, action
4. Success criteria (from COS, often expressed as a quantitative business outcome)
5. Assumptions, risks, obstacles, limits/exclusions etc.
