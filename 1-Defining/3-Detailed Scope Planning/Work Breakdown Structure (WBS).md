An outline of the project with different levels of detail.
The WBS is best suited for design and build projects that have tangible outcomes

A hierarchical process of dividing up the work into Work Packages (WPs). These are discrete units of work, detailed to the level where one person can do the work. WBS shows the relationship between units of work.

## Creating a WBS (levels)

The WBS begins with the project as the final deliverable. Major project work deliverables/systems are identified first; then the subdeliverables necessary to accomplish the larger deliverables are
defined. The process is repeated until the subdeliverable detail is small enough to be manageable and one person can be responsible. This subdeliverable is further divided into work packages. Because the lowest subdeliverable usually includes several work packages, the work packages
are grouped by type of workâ€”for example, design and testing. These groupings within a subdeliverable are called cost accounts. This grouping facilitates a system for monitoring project progress by work, cost, and responsibility.
