For small projects, a simple way to scope out roles is to develop a Role and Responsibility Matrix (RACI)

**Guidelines:**
1. Place Accountability (A) and Responsibility (R) at the lowest feasible level.
2. There can be only one accountable individual per activity
3. Authority must accompany accountability
4. Minimize the number of Consults (C) and Informs(I)
5. All roles and responsibilities must be documented and communicated
6. Discipline is needed to keep the roles and responsibilities clear. “Drift” happens.
