Item Name: Map of Diagram Hell

TRADEABLE, RARE 

Type: Miscellaneous

Description:
This tattered parchment, reeking faintly of burnt coffee and existential dread, promises a glimpse into the labyrinthine realm known as Projektledelse og Forunde...Diagram Hell. Here, logic curdles, arrows turn on themselves, and flowcharts loop into an eternity of frustration.
The map itself is a chaotic mess of faded lines, nonsensical symbols, and cryptic annotations. Legends speak of hidden shortcuts and devious traps, but deciphering them  might be a task more suited for the architects of madness themselves.


Requirements:
- Obsidian: A shard of volcanic glass, rumored to offer a sliver of clarity amidst the maddening confusion.
