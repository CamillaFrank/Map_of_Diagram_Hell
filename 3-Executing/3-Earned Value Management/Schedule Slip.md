When a project fails to meet its schedule commitments
## What if the schedule slips?
Different strategies can be adopted depending on what your role is:
Project Manager-Based Strategies:
- Problem detection and solving problem
- No action is required. Problem will self-correct
- Examine dependency relationships -> replanning
- Reassign resources
Resource Manager-Based Strategies:
- Negotiate additional resources or reassign resources
Client-Based Strategies:
- Negotiate multiple release strategies
- Request schedule extension
