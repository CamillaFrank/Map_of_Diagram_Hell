provides a quick overview about the state of the project

If EV below PV, we are “earning” below our planned value.
If EV below AC, we are spending more money than we are “earning”

In Figure 13.4 the top line represents the actual costs (AC) incurred for the project work to date. The middle line is the baseline (PV) and ends at the scheduled project duration (45). The bottom line is the budgeted value of the work actually completed to date (EV), or the earned value. The dotted line extending the actual costs from the report date to the new estimated completion date represents revised estimates of expected actual costs; that is, additional information suggests the costs at completion of the project will differ from what was planned. ([[Estimated cost at completion (EAC)]] is higher than [[Budgeted cost at completion (BAC)]])

Another interpretation of the graph uses percentages. At the end of period 25, 75 percent of the work was scheduled to be accomplished. At the end of period 25, the value of the work accomplished is 50 percent. The actual cost of the work completed to date is $340, or 85 percent of the total project budget. The graph suggests the project will have about an 18 percent cost overrun and be five time units late. The current status of the project shows the cost variance (CV) to be over budget by $140 (EV − AC = 200 − 340 = −140). The schedule variance (SV) is negative $100 (EV − PV = 200 − 300 = −100), which suggests the project is behind schedule.
