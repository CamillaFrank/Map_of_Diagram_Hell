A methodology that combines scope, schedule, and resource measurements to assess project performance and progress. Utilizes [[Earned Value (EV)]]

**Steps:**
1. (Planning Stage) Define the work using a WBS.
2. (Planning Stage) Develop work and resource schedule.
3. (Planning Stage) Develop a time-phase budget using work packages included in an activity. The cumulative values of these budgets will become the baseline and will be called the planned budgeted cost of the work scheduled (Planned Value (PV)).
4. At the work package level, collect the actual costs for the work performed (Actual Cost (AC)). Collect percent complete and multiply this times the original budget amount for the value of the work actually completed (Earned Value (EV))
5. Compute the Schedule Variance (SV) and Cost Variance (CV).


**Assessing the current status of a project** using the earned value cost/schedule system requires three data elementsâ€”planned cost of the work scheduled (Planned Value (PV)), budgeted cost of the work completed (Earned Value (EV)), and actual cost of the work completed (Actual Cost (AC)). From these data the schedule variance and cost variance are computed each reporting period. A positive variance indicates a desirable condition, while a negative variance suggests problems or changes that have taken place.
