Earned Value (EV) is the budgeted cost of work performed and is used as a measure of the value created in a project
EV = percent complete Ã— original budget, i.e., the value created by the actual work performed

Work accomplished is often measured in terms of percentages (e.g., 25% complete) in which case, EV is simply percent complete times its original budget.
