Used to track project progress via milestones. Helps PMs assess the health of a project
- Shows time on both axis
- Each milestone a graph, with original target deadline on the diagonal line
- If during project a milestone is redefined with a new target completion date, we make a new point in the graph
- If trendline is not horizontal, we have a deviation. Upwards trendline indicates delays
