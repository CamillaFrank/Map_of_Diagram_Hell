Graphical presentation of tasks planned completed vs. tasks actually completed. Time-perspective only. Does NOT show WHY there is a deviation â€“or if/how that affects costs

**Positive Variances:** deviations from the plan indicating that an ahead-of-schedule or a cost less than budgeted has occurred (effort vs. progress)
**Negative Variances:** deviations from the plan indicating that a behind-schedule or cost greater than the budget has occurred (effort vs. progress)
