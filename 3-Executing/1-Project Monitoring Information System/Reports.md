Reports seek to enable data-driven decision making. 
Project control reports can have different purposes, e.g.: Current period reports, Cumulative reports, Variance reports.

**A common topic format for progress reports:**
- Progress since last report
- Current status of project
	1. Schedule
	2. Cost
	3. Scope
- Cumulative trends
- Problems and issues since last report
	1. Actions and resolution of earlier problems
	2. New variances and problems identified
- Corrective action planned


**Good analysis reports characteristics:**
- Should engage and inform the user
- Timely, complete, accurate, and intuitive
- Isnâ€™t burdensome and counterproductive
- An effective early warning system
- Easily understood by those who need to know
- Readily acceptable to senior management
- Uses a common, easily understood and agreed-upon format and language (standardization vs. adaptation)

None of this specifies a report should be a written document! Could be Dashboards, Graphs, Personal adaptive visualisations, Audio journey? VR-based walkthrough?
