Data collected are determined by which metrics will be used for project control.
**Typical key data collected are** actual activity duration times, resource usage and rates, and actual costs, which are compared against planned times, resources, and budgets.
## Questions we would like to be able to answer 
(at any time during a project)
- What is the current status of the project in terms of schedule and cost?(or progress and effort)
- How much will it cost to complete the project?
- When will the project be completed?
- Are there potential problems that need to be addressed now?
- What, who, and where are the causes for cost or schedule overruns?
- If there is a cost overrun midway in the project, can we forecast the overrun at completion?

The performance metrics you need to collect should support answering these questions.

## Collecting Data
Will the data be collected by the project team, contractor, independent cost engineers, project manager? Or will the data be derived electronically from some form of surrogate data such as cash flow, machine hours, labor hours, or materials in place? Should the reporting period be one hour, one day, one week, or what? Is there a central repository for the data collected and is someone responsible for its dissemination?
