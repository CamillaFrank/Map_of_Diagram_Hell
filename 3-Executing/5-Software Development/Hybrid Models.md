Sometimes organizations use both traditional and Agile methods to complete a project.

Although some companies have successfully applied Agile PM to large projects, others have struggled with the scaling challenge. This has led many companies to use hybrid models on large projects that combine waterfall and Agile methods.

For example, Agile PM is used up front to resolve key scope questions and define requirements. Once the features or requirements are known, then traditional PM is applied to complete the project.
Alternatively, on some projects the requirements are known but there is uncertainty regarding the technology. Here, incremental experimentation would be used early to resolve technical issues, allowing for a formal implementation plan.

Finally, it is common to find teams using Agile techniques on plan-driven projects. For example, daily stand-up meetings to coordinate efforts have become commonplace in many organizations. Teams also use shorter iterations and retrospectives to get critical customer feedback. Kanban methods are used by traditional teams to visualize work and identify bottlenecks in the project schedule.
