- Focus on customer value. Employ business-driven prioritizations of requirements and features.
- Iterative and incremental delivery. Create a flow of value to customers by “chunking” project delivery into small, functioning increments.
- Experimentation and adaptation. Test assumptions early and build working prototypes to solicit customer feedback and refine product requirements.
- Self-organization. Team members decide among themselves what should be done and who should do it.
- Servant leadership. The project manager facilitates rather than directs collaboration.
- Continuous improvement. Teams reflect, learn, and adapt to change; work informs the plan.
