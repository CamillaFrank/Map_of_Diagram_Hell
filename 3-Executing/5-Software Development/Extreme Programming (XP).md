XP attempts to reduce the cost of changes in requirements by having multiple, short development cycles, rather than a long one. Considers change a natural, even desirable aspect of software development projects and should be planned for, instead of eliminated.

Two of the guiding features of XP are **test-driven development** and **pair programming**.

XP is founded on five values:
- Communication. The goal is to give all developers a shared view of the system, which matches the view held by the users of the system. To this end, XP favors simple designs, common metaphors, collaboration of users and programmers, frequent verbal communication, and feedback.
- Simplicity. XP encourages starting with the simplest solution. Extra functionality can then be added later.
- Feedback. Rapid testing reduces errors and ensures work is responsive to customer needs.
- Courage. Several practices embody courage. One is the commandment to always design and code for today and not for tomorrow. This is an effort to avoid getting bogged down in design and requiring a lot of effort to implement anything else. Another example of courage is knowing when to throw code away: courage to remove source code that is obsolete, no matter how much effort was used to create that source code.
- Respect. This includes respect for others as well as self-respect. Nobody on the team should feel unappreciated or ignored. This ensures a high level of motivation and encourages loyalty toward the team and toward the goal of the project.
