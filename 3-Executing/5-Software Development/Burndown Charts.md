## Release Burndown Chart
This chart displays the amount of work remaining across time. Before the start of each sprint, completion estimates are revised in the product backlog and totaled in the release burndown chart. Over time the chart becomes an excellent method for visualizing the relationship between amount of work remaining and the rate at which the team is reducing this work.
