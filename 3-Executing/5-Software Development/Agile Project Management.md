The final project design is not known in great detail and is continuously developed through a series of incremental iterations over time. The goal of each iteration is to develop a workable product that satisfies one or more desired product features to demonstrate to the customer and other key stakeholders.

Agile advocates recommend creating a [[Hub Project Management Structure]] with overlapping roles and responsibilities to manage large projects.

Advantages:
- Continuous integration, verification, and validation of the evolving product.
- Frequent demonstration of progress to increase the likelihood that the end product will satisfy customer needs.
- Early detection of defects and problems.

Limits and concerns:
The biggest reasons for failure were (1) lack of experience with agile methods, (2) company culture at odds with core agile values, (3) lack of management support, and (4) external pressure to follow the traditional waterfall process. Many of the Agile principles, including self-organizing teams and intense collaboration, are incompatible with corporate cultures. Agile PM does not satisfy top managementâ€™s need for control.


It should be noted that Agile PM is not one set method but a family of methods designed to respond to the challenges of unpredictable projects. A few of the more popular ones:
 - [[Scrum]] 
 - [[Extreme Programming (XP)]]
 - RUP (Rational Unified Process)
 - Crystal Clear
 - Agile Modeling 
 - Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
 - Learn Development 
 - Rapid Product Development (RPD)
