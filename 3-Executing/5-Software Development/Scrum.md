Scrum, like other Agile methods, begins with a high-level scope definition and ballpark time and cost estimates for the project. The scope and cost estimates should be complete enough that management are comfortable with the estimates. The theory is that since requirements evolve over time, detailed up-front planning will be wasted. In place of a product WBS, Scrum uses product features as deliverables. 

**A feature** is defined as a piece of a product that delivers some useful functionality to a customer. Features are prioritized by their perceived highest value. The project team tackles the highest-priority feasible features first. Priorities are re-evaluated after each iteration. Iterations are called sprints and should last no longer than four weeks. The goal of each sprint is to produce fully functional features. Specific features are created according to four distinct phases: analysis, design, build, and test Each feature can be thought of as a mini-project.

There are three key roles to the scrum process: product owner, development team, and Scrum master.

Scrum uses a series of coordinated meetings to manage the development process:

Agile favors empirical and value-based measurement instead of predictive measurement. Scrum uses [[Burndown Charts]], which focus on the work remaining and are used to track progress.
