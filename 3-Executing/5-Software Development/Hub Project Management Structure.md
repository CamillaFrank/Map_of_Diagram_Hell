Significant up front planning is required to manage the interdependences of different features that will be developed. This is called “staging” and often is the subject of the first development iteration.

Agile advocates recommend creating a hub structure with overlapping roles and responsibilities to manage large projects. There are several feature development teams. A separate integration and build team is formed consisting of part-time members of each feature team. This team tackles the sticky integration issue through testing and establishing requirements for the feature teams.
