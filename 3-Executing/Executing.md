When the client is satisfied that the acceptance criteria have been met the project enters the Closing phase
## The Project Control Process
1. **Setting a baseline plan** 
	- All the work we have done in previous steps
2. **Ongoing measuring progress and performance**
3. **Comparing baseline plan against actual progress and performance**
4. **Taking action on deviations from baseline plan**
	- If deviations from plans are significant, corrective action will be needed to bring the project back in line with the original or revised plan.

## The Problem Escalation Strategy Hierarchy
We need to have a strategy for how we deal with deviations â€“starting with no action, all the way to extending the schedule, e.g.:
1. Smallest action/response No action required (schedule slack will correct the problem)
2. Examines work package/deliverable dependencies for schedule compression opportunities
3. Reassign resources from non-critical path tasks to cover the slippage
4. Negotiate additional resources
5. Negotiate multiple release strategies
6. Highest action/response: Request schedule extension (or resources, but might not solve the problem) from the client
